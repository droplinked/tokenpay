# Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the required environment variables along with their values to this file.
3. Ensure that the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.
#

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL`: This variable specifies the base URL for the API endpoints. It should be set to `https://apiv3.droplinked.com/v1/`

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY`: This variable should be obtained from the dashboard. It represents the API key required to authenticate requests to the backend API.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DEVELOPMENT`: This variable should be set to either `"true"` or `"false"`. It determines whether the application is running in development mode or not. Setting it to `"true"` indicates a development environment, while setting it to `"false"` indicates a production environment.
#
Here's an example of how the `.env` file should look:
```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL=https://apiv3.droplinked.com/v1/
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_goes_here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DEVELOPMENT="true"
```


## Landing Page Documentation

The landing page is designed to display shop data followed by a list of products, dynamically fetched from separate APIs.

### Fetching Data

#### Shop Data
- **API Call**: Data about the shop is fetched from the `get_shop_service` API.

```typescript
export const get_shop_service = () â‡’ fetchInstance(`shop`, { cache: "force-cache" })
```

#### Product Data

- **API Call**: Product data is fetched from the **`get_products_service`** API, which supports pagination, filtering, and a limit on the number of items per fetch.

```typescript
export const get_products_service = ({ page, limit, filter }: IGetProductsService) =>
	fetchInstance(`products?page=${page}${limit && `&limit=${limit}`}${filter && `&filter=title:${filter}`}`, { next: { revalidate: 3600 } });
	
export interface IGetProductsService{
    page: number;
    limit?: number;
    filter?: string
}
```

## Managing shopping cart operations:

### **2. Services**

These functions interact with a backend API to perform CRUD operations on a shopping cart.

- **`create_cart_service()`**: Initializes a new cart session by making a POST request to the /cart endpoint.
```typescript
export const create_cart_service = () => fetchInstance(`cart`, { method: "POST" });
```


- **`add_to_cart_service`**: Adds an item to a specified cart by sending a POST request to cart/${cartId} with the item details.
```typescript
export const add_to_cart_service = ({ cartId, ...body }: IAddToCartService) => fetchInstance(`cart/${cartId}`, { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify(body) });
export interface IAddToCartService {
    cartId: string;
    shopID: string;
    skuID: string;
    quantity: number;
    m2m_data?: IM2MProps;
}

export interface IM2MProps {
    m2m_position: string;
    print_url: string;
}
```

- **`change_quantity_service`**: Updates the quantity of an item in the cart by sending a PATCH request to /cart/${cartId}.

```typescript
export const change_quantity_service = ({ cartId, ...body }: ICahngeQuantityService) => fetchInstance(`cart/${cartId}`, { method: "PATCH", body: JSON.stringify(body) });

export interface ICahngeQuantityService extends Omit<IAddToCartService, "m2m_data"> {
    itemId: string;
}
```


- **`get_cart_service`**: Retrieves the cart's current state by making a GET request to /cart/${cartId}.
```typescript
export const get_cart_service = ({ cartId }: IGetCartService) => fetchInstance(`cart/${cartId}`);

export interface IGetCartService {
    cartId: string;
}
```

### **2. Hook (`useAppCart`)**

This custom hook integrates the services, managing the state of the shopping cart using a store.

### **Functions:**

- **`_update()`**: A helper function that updates the cart state and returns the updated data.
- **`_create()`**: Creates a new cart by calling an asynchronous service and updates the global cart state upon successful creation.
- **`_add_params({ skuID, quantity, m2m_data })`**: Prepares and returns the parameters needed for the **`add_to_cart_service`** function by ensuring a cart ID is available, either from the existing state or by creating a new cart.
- **`add()`**: Adds an item to the cart using the **`add_to_cart_service`**. It handles both the addition of the item and updating the global cart state.
- **`change({ cartId, skuID, quantity, itemId })`**: Changes the quantity of an existing item in the cart and updates the state.
- **`get(_id)`**: Retrieves a cart's details based on cart ID and updates the app state.
- **`_add_email(params)`**: Adds an email to the cart as part of the checkout process and updates the state.
- **`add_address(params, email)`**: First adds an email to the cart and then an address, updating the state after each operation.
- **`add_shipping({ cartId, rates })`**: Adds shipping information to the cart and updates the state.
- **`add_gift(params)`**: Applies a gift card to the cart and updates the state.


# Managing Crypto Payment

## useWeb3 Hook

- **`payment`**: An array of type **`IPaymentDroplinked[]`** which lists all available payment options along with details like labels, descriptions, and icons for both light and dark themes. Each option include a token type and an enum number.

```typescript
export type IPaymentDroplinked = {
    type: string;
    options: { [propname in keyof Partialize<PaymentTypes>]: PaymentDroplinkedOptions }[];
};
```

## usePayment Hook

- **`crypto_payment`**: A function intended to handle cryptocurrency payments. It uses the **`selected_method`** from the checkout state to determine the payment method and processes the payment accordingly. It includes obtaining wallet addresses, initiating transactions, and managing the checkout and submission of orders.

- install the @droplinked/wallet-connection package in your project.
  ```bash
  npm install @droplinked/wallet-connection
  ```
  After installing the package, import the necessary utilities into your file where you're defining the crypto_payment function. Import getNetworkProvider and Network from @droplinked/wallet-connection. You can do this as follows:
  ```typescript
  import { getNetworkProvider, Network } from "@droplinked/wallet-connection";
  ```
    ```typescript
    const crypto_payment = async ({selected_method: {name: paymentType, enum_number, token}}: Pick<ICheckoutState, "selected_method">) => {
        if(paymentType === "" || paymentType === "STRIPE") return
        const sender: string = await (await getNetworkProvider(enum_number, APP_DEVELOPMENT ? Network.TESTNET : Network.MAINNET, "").walletLogin())?.address;
        let checkout = await (await checkout_crypto_payment_service({ cartId: _id, paymentType, token, email, walletAddress: sender }));
        if (checkout) {
            const paymentResult = getNetworkProvider(enum_number, APP_DEVELOPMENT ? Network.TESTNET : Network.MAINNET, sender);
            const payment = await paymentResult?.payment(checkout?.paymentData);
            await submit_order_service({
                chain: paymentType?.toLowerCase(),
                deploy_hash: payment?.deploy_hash,
                orderID: checkout?.orderID,
                cryptoAmount: parseInt(payment?.cryptoAmount),
            }).finally(() => {
                transition("submitting", false);
                router.push(`/checkout/${checkout?.orderID}`);
            });
        }
       
    };
    ```


### **Detailed Function Description**

**`crypto_payment`:** This asynchronous function handles the payment process when cryptocurrency is chosen as the payment method.

### Parameters:

- **`selected_method`**: An object from **`ICheckoutState`** containing:
    - **`name`**: The name of the payment method.
    - **`enum_number`**: An integer representing an identifier for the payment method.
    - **`token`**: A token type associated with the payment.
        
        ```typescript
        selected_method: {
        	name: keyof Partialize<PaymentTypes> | "",
        	token: keyof Partialize<TokenTypes> | "",
        	enum_number: number
        }
        ```
        

### Process:

1. Retrieves the wallet address or public key from a blockchain network provider based on the **`enum_number`** and whether the app is in development mode (determines if it connects to a testnet or mainnet).
    
    ```typescript
    const sender: string = await (await getNetworkProvider(enum_number, APP_DEVELOPMENT ? Network.TESTNET : Network.MAINNET, "").walletLogin())[paymentType === "CASPER" ? "publicKey" : "address"];
    ```
    
2. Initiates a payment through a checkout service and then proceeds with blockchain-specific payment processing.
    
    ```typescript
    export const checkout_crypto_payment_service = ({ cartId, paymentType, token, ...body }: ICheckoutCryptoPaymentService) =>
        fetchInstance(`checkout/${cartId}/payment/${paymentType}/${token}`, { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify(body) });
    
    let checkout = await (await checkout_crypto_payment_service({ cartId: _id, paymentType, token, email, walletAddress: sender }));
    ```
    
3. Submits the completed order to the order service, capturing essential transaction details like the deploy hash and order ID.
    
    ```typescript
    const paymentResult = getNetworkProvider(enum_number, APP_DEVELOPMENT ? Network.TESTNET : Network.MAINNET, sender);
    const payment = await paymentResult?.payment(checkout?.paymentData);
    await submit_order_service({ chain: paymentType?.toLowerCase(), deploy_hash: payment?.deploy_hash, orderID: checkout?.orderID, cryptoAmount: parseInt(payment?.cryptoAmount)}
    ```
    
4. Handles the transaction completion or failure, updating the application state and routing the user accordingly.
    
    ```typescript
    transition("submitting", false);
    router.push(`/checkout/${checkout?.orderID}`);
    ```
